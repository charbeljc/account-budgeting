   I select for this file a user that is not admin
-
  !context
    uid: 'res_users_colette'
-
  I create a lead
-
  !record {model: crm.lead, id: lead_1}:
    name: "Sell something"
    section_id: crm.crm_case_section_1
-
  I check that the Analytic Account comes from the lead's Team
-
  !python {model: crm.lead}: |
    lead = model.browse(cr, uid, ref('lead_1'))
    assert lead.analytic_account_id.id == ref('account.analytic_commercial_marketing'), "Analytic Account of the lead does not come automatically from the team of the lead"
