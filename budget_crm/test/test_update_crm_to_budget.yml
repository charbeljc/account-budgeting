   I select for this file a user that is not admin

  !context
    uid: 'res_users_colette'

  I update the amount and months in my lead
-
  !record {model: crm.lead, id: lead_2}:
    months: 2
    planned_revenue: 200.0
    budget_item_id: budget_item_1
-
  I create a new wizard on the lame lead
-
  !record {model: crm.to.budget.wizard, id: wizard_2}:
-
  I run the wizard on one opportunity
-
  !python {model: crm.to.budget.wizard}: |
    model.do_compute(cr, uid, [ref('wizard_2')], context={
      'active_ids': [ref('lead_2')]
    })
-
  The budget version should now have only 4 lines, of which 2 existing and 2
  attached to this lead.
-
  !python {model: budget.version}: |
    version = model.browse(cr, uid, ref('budget_version_1'), context)
    assert len(version.budget_line_ids) == 4, 'There should be 4 lines: 2 old and 2 new'
